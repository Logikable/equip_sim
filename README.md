# Comprehensive Equipment Systems Guide

## Motivation

One reason people play MMOs is to feel a sense of progression. There are several forms of progression; story, ability, and wealth.
However, the type of progression that interests me the most is that of equipment. There's an allure to clearing content twice as fast as someone else, despite being the same class and level.

This guide is not for every MMO - many great games have stuck to a simple, predictable, rarity-powered equipment system. Examples that come to mind are Guild Wars and Runescape.
This guide is meant for the *other* type of MMO. You know the type: Black Desert Online, Maplestory, Dungeon Fighter Online, Lineage. The Korean RNG simulators.
This guide is meant for games that wish to take the easy route and make a game without a passionate story or mechanically challenging raid bosses.

### What sucks

Equipment systems that can result in backward progress (-P) suck. People play MMOs for a natural, consistent progression that only rewards effort.
To increase play time, current systems are plagued with mechanics that can set the player back a long way like destruction chance, stat reroll, and duplicate item consumption.
These mechanics also open the door to P2W features that neutralize -P: item destruction can be avoided with protection scrolls, stat reroll consumables have alternatives that allow the preservation of the previous roll, and duplicate items can be substituted with cash shop equivalents.

-P mechanics also don't account for the possibility of human error. I, for one, have certainly forgotten to use a protection scroll before attempting an upgrade, only to see my precious item vanish.

### What works

Non-negative progress (0P) and forward progress (+P) mechanics are particularly favourable. +P systems include levels and EXP - everything done provides progress. 0P systems imply no progress most of the time, but some substantial progress at discrete time intervals.

**Warning:** 0P systems do not always work. For example, scrolling in Maplestory is a 0P mechanic (ignoring scrolls with destruction chance). However, because there are several options for the same scroll with different numerical bonuses (+1, +3, +5), and scrolls cannot be undone, new players may find themselves regretting a past choice when trying to min/max.

### Disclaimer

This guide aims to be a comprehensive list of equipment enhancement systems found in other games that I deem "fun". It's subjective and consequently open to criticism.
The mechanics are as detached from actual bonuses as much as possible, so as to allow them to fit into any genre or theme. That said, many of these ideas are sourced from Maplestory, so I have a biased view.

## Mechanics

This section contains a list of different equipment progression mechanics that you can include in your system, each with a short description. This list is always expanding.

An asterisk (\*) represents an avant garde idea.

### Grind

This section of mechanics focuses on those whose defining feature is the necessity of a grind. While technically every mechanic is a grind, those that can be solved with wealth are sectioned elsewhere.

#### Levels

The simplest mechanic is one that is limited by time spent playing only. Experience points and levels allow for an item to naturally progress over time through usage, without the player needing to perform upgrades.
Since the purpose is to allow the player to constantly be progressing with no input, level ups need to be seamless, at most with a mess of particle effects to indicate a discrete progression.
This means that players should not need to press a button to level up their equipment, or worse talk to an NPC.

Like all experience systems, levels should be exponentially harder to obtain. Sounds extreme; it just means that XP requirements should double every X levels (instead of increasing linearly, for example).
Optionally, the bonuses may scale with level (+2 from levels 1-5, then +3 from levels 6-10), to make up for the extra difficulty of later levels.
Do ensure that bonuses are smaller than those from other mechanics, as we want to encourage smart playing (wealth accumulation) rather than a boring grind.

#### (\*) Prestiging gear

You may want to allow players to reset their levels in exchange for a small bonus. Perhaps too many players have hit the level cap. This is an effective way to multiply playtime for a small amount of work.
Not much to say here other than that this is a rarer mechanic in equipment systems.

**Warning:** players may be discouraged from prestiging if they temporarily lose bonuses from levelling by prestiging.

### RNG

This section of mechanics contains those that involve some form of RNG. While most mechanics fall under this section, most fall under a small number of categories. These categories are:

#### Currency-based enhancement

Mobs may drop a variable amount of some form of currency that players need to collect a certain amount of to upgrade their equipment. In Maplestory, the equivalent are spell traces.
This category almost fits under grind - while it is necessary that players accumulate a number of currency over time, wealthy players can opt to simply buy upgrade currency with the regular currency.

Like levelling, it is expected that most players max out this category of enhancements, since it is a linear system that needs to be within reach of all players. Therefore, I don't encourage them providing significant bonuses.

#### Consumable-based enhancement (scrolling)

#### (\*) Preservable RNG (black cubes)

### Transferable

#### (Upgradeable) Removable slotted items (souls, nebulites)
#### (\*) XP Containers (note: requires non-scaling XP gain for proper balance)

### Universal

#### Tiered systems (cubing)
#### Permanent +1 slots/levels/stars (golden hammer)
#### (\*) Temporarily improved RNG (single attempt)
