# Comprehensive Equipment Systems Guide

## Motivation

One reason people play MMOs is to feel a sense of progression. There are several forms of progression; story, ability, and wealth.
However, the type of progression that interests me the most is that of equipment. There's an allure to clearing content twice as fast as someone else, despite being the same class and level.

This guide is not for every MMO - many great games have stuck to a simple, predictable, rarity-powered equipment system. Examples that come to mind are Guild Wars and Runescape.
This guide is meant for the *other* type of MMO. You know the type: Black Desert Online, Maplestory, Dungeon Fighter Online, Lineage. The Korean RNG simulators.
This guide is meant for games that wish to take the easy route and make a game without a passionate story or mechanically challenging raid bosses.

### What sucks

Equipment systems that can result in backward progress (-P) suck. People play MMOs for a natural, consistent progression that only rewards effort.
To increase play time, current systems are plagued with mechanics that can set the player back a long way like destruction chance, stat reroll, and duplicate item consumption.
These mechanics also open the door to P2W features that neutralize -P: item destruction can be avoided with protection scrolls, stat reroll consumables have alternatives that allow the preservation of the previous roll, and duplicate items can be substituted with cash shop equivalents.
-P mechanics also don't account for the possibility of human error. I, for one, have certainly forgotten to use a protection scroll before attempting an upgrade, only to see my precious item vanish.

### What works

Non-negative progress (0P) and forward progress (+P) mechanics are particularly favourable. +P systems include levels and EXP - everything done provides progress. 0P systems imply no progress most of the time, but some substantial progress at discrete time intervals.
Be warned: 0P systems do not always work. For example, scrolling in Maplestory is a 0P mechanic (ignoring scrolls with destruction chance). However, because there are several options for the same scroll with different numerical bonuses (+1, +3, +5), and scrolls cannot be undone, new players may find themselves regretting a past choice when trying to min/max.

### Disclaimer

This guide aims to be a comprehensive list of equipment enhancement systems found in other games that I deem "fun". It's subjective and consequently open to criticism.
The mechanics are as detached from actual bonuses as much as possible, so as to allow them to fit into any genre or theme.

## Core Mechanics

An asterisk represents an avant garde idea.

### Grind

#### Levelling system + tiers (e.g. potential tiers)
The simple

#### (\*) Prestiging gear (note: players may be discouraged from prestiging if there is a temporary loss of bonuses)

RNG:
- Currency-based enhancement (spell shards)
- Consumable-based enhancement (scrolling)
- \*Preservable RNG (black cubes)

Transferable:
- (Upgradeable) Removable slotted items (souls, nebulites)
- \*XP Containers (note: requires non-scaling XP gain for proper balance)

Supplementary:
- Permanent +1 slots/levels/stars (golden hammer)
- \*Temporarily improved RNG (single attempt)
